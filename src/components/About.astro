        I'm a Neo4j-certified graph database engineer with a decade of building
        and testing production software at companies ranging from 10-person
        startups to Fortune 500s.

        I love new technology. I also know that most of it doesn't survive
        contact with real-world data. So MSS operates on a simple principle: be
        curious enough to explore what's possible, but grounded enough to build
        what's practical.

        If you want to see how I think about data, StatFoundry is an NFL
        analytics platform I built on a Neo4j graph database — my playground for
        testing ideas before they reach client work. For a closer look at what
        I'm building and how, check out the MSS Blog. To stay up to date with
        what I'm following in graph databases and AI, there's Practical Graph &
        AI Insights. And if you've got a data problem worth solving, let's talk.
