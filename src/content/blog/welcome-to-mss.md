## Meet MSS, Medcalf Software Solutions

Hello and welcome to Medcalf Software Solutions, a development studio specializing
in providing custom test, integration and deployment solutions for mobile, web and backend
applications.

My background is somewhat unconventional - I'm completely self-taught,
working my way up from support roles to engineering without a college
degree.

I vividly remember in 2014 when Robbie, the Tier 2 Support Manager and my first mentor, showed me, then a customer service rep, a simple Swagger page.

It was like peeking behind a curtain.

Since then, I've been obsessed with learning what makes the technology we use every day tick.

Over the last 10 years, I've built test automation frameworks and CI/CD pipelines everywhere from early-stage startups to
Fortune 500 companies.

To nab my first QA role, I taught myself bash so I could build Jenkins jobs
that would deploy, run and test apps on iPhone 6s hanging off of a Mac Mini.

Now, I just need to remember to lint my yml files. Soon, I'll just be prompting
Claude.

Over the years, I've learned that the best approach to ensuring quality is holistic -- it's not simply about running tests.

Neither is it about the quantifiable metrics like number of tests written, bugs caught, time to release etc.

It's about agreeing on table stakes before dealing the cards.

It's about aligning all parties on expectations so that validations are
irrefutable, agreed upon, and first-class citizens in the development
process.

In other words, it's not about speaking the same language, its about comprehending it too.

At MSS, we pride ourselves on being able to build high quality test automation
and deployment systems that cater to the unique needs of each one of our
customers.

## But wait, there's more!

I have always been a compulsive tinkerer, with a restless curiosity and voracious appetite for
the new and novel.

Thus, the current landscape is the kind of green field that gets me
excited enough to quit my job so image can frolic in the tall grasses of Agentic
AI, Knowledge Graphs and MCP Servers.

## Meet MSS Labs

Currently, MSS Labs is the corner of my office where I have whiteboards that look like this.

It is a place where I explicitly carve out time to dive into emerging
technologies.

It's where I spin up Agentic AI so I can have my own "money guy", or where I build a graph database of the NFL so I can use PageRank to "Google for a
Superbowl".

It's _also_ where there is some exciting news, so stay tuned!

## See you around!

Thank you for taking the time to learn about our humble studio.

If I'm speaking your language, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to connect and explore how I can collaborate or assist with your software needs. [Contact me here](/#contact), and be sure to keep your eye on this blog, where I will not only be sharing the spicy things MSS Labs is cooking up, but _also_ sharing something potentially even spicier...my opinions.
