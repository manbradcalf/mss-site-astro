    <h2>What We Build</h2>
    <p>
      We build end-to-end document processing pipelines that automatically extract, categorize, and structure data from your business-critical documents. Our systems combine:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Multi-stage prompting methodology</strong> - Initial extraction followed by validation and refinement for maximum accuracy</li>
      <li><strong>Structured outputs</strong> - Clean, validated JSON data ready for integration with your existing systems</li>
      <li><strong>Human-in-the-loop workflows</strong> - Strategic checkpoints where accuracy matters most, ensuring confidence in automated results</li>
      <li><strong>Reusable architecture</strong> - Built to scale across multiple document types with minimal reconfiguration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unlike generic OCR or extraction tools, we build custom pipelines tailored to your specific document types, business rules, and accuracy requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Our proven document processing approach follows a systematic methodology:</p>

    <h3>Stage 1: Initial Extraction</h3>
    <p>
      Advanced language models analyze your documents to identify and extract key fields, relationships, and data points. This stage focuses on comprehensive capture, ensuring no critical information is missed.
    </p>

    <h3>Stage 2: Validation & Refinement</h3>
    <p>
      A second pass validates extracted data against business rules, cross-checks for consistency, and applies domain-specific logic. This two-stage approach dramatically improves accuracy over single-pass extraction.
    </p>

    <h3>Stage 3: Human Review (Where It Matters)</h3>
    <p>
      Strategic human-in-the-loop checkpoints focus expert review where it's most valuable. Rather than reviewing every document, your team validates edge cases and trains the system to handle similar scenarios automatically in the future.
    </p>

    <h3>Stage 4: Integration & Delivery</h3>
    <p>
      Structured data flows seamlessly into your databases, CRMs, accounting systems, or data warehouses. We handle the integration work so extracted data is immediately actionable.
    </p>

    <h2>Case Study: SegTax Settlement Statements</h2>
    <div class="case-study">
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        SegTax needed to process hundreds of real estate settlement statements to extract and categorize line items for tax reporting. These documents varied significantly in format, contained complex financial calculations, and required high accuracy for regulatory compliance.
      </p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>
        We built a two-stage document processing pipeline that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extracted all line items with associated amounts and descriptions</li>
        <li>Categorized each item according to SegTax's proprietary taxonomy</li>
        <li>Validated calculations and flagged discrepancies</li>
        <li>Structured output for seamless database integration</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>90%+ extraction accuracy</strong> on complex, varied document formats</li>
        <li><strong>75% reduction in manual review time</strong> through intelligent automation</li>
        <li><strong>Scalable architecture</strong> ready for multiple additional document types</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid production deployment</strong> from initial concept to working system</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Testimonial</h3>
  <blockquote>
   "Ben integrated the ChatGPT API into our platform to extract data from unstructured settlement statement pdfs. This required diving into the complex domain of real estate accounting and using artificial intelligence to extract, categorize, and produce structured data from this unstructured data source of PDF with varying formats.

I was impressed with Ben's ability to build a PoC quickly - iterate on feedback and then integrate a usable solution into our production software stack. 

Also Ben has a great attitude and is fun to work with."
